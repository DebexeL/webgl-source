Fix skybox
	Warning: WebGL: A texture is going to be rendered as if it were black, as per the OpenGL ES 2.0.24 spec section 3.8.2, because it is a cube map texture, with a minification filter not requiring a mipmap, and is not cube complete (as defined in section 3.7.10).

Texture quality selector UI
Normal mapping on brush surfaces
Displacement surfaces! (on bsp brushes)
Water rendering
3D skybox
Shaders that use cubemaps
Un-gzip and use materials (i.e. cube maps) embedded in BSP
Skinning (could be difficult due to optimizations that assume lots of static meshes)
Sort transparent geometry back-to-front before rendering
Draw skybox after opaque, before transparent
Mouse lock once API is available?
