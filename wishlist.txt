Fix skybox
"I looked at model shader source and you have 1 really basic mistake or oversimplification. You normalize light direction and eye direction vectors in vertex shader. Normalization isn't an operation that can be factored out of fragment shader into vertex shader."
Texture quality selector UI
Normal mapping on brush surfaces
Displacement surfaces! (on bsp brushes)
Water rendering
3D skybox
Shaders that use cubemaps
Un-gzip and use materials (i.e. cube maps) embedded in BSP
Skinning (could be difficult due to optimizations that assume lots of static meshes)
Sort transparent geometry back-to-front before rendering
Draw skybox after opaque, before transparent
Mouse lock once API is available?
