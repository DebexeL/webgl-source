TODO Items For demo: (Must have!)
    - Improve material parsing (Normal Maps, etc)
    - Implement displacement surfaces
    - Figure out something for water
    - Skybox
    - Collision detection
    
Ideas/Optimizations:
    - Load all data in Web Workers
    - Group mesh verts/indicies into buffers before sending to GPU
    - Pre-sort props by buffer/shader/texture/etc
    - Material management system (don't double-load, limit uploads)
    
Questions:
    - How do we handle sorting of transparent surfaces?
