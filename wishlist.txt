Fix skybox
Texture quality selector UI
Normal mapping on brush surfaces
Displacement surfaces! (on bsp brushes)
Water rendering
3D skybox
Shaders that use cubemaps
Un-gzip and use materials (i.e. cube maps) embedded in BSP
Skinning (could be difficult due to optimizations that assume lots of static meshes)
Sort transparent geometry back-to-front before rendering
Draw skybox after opaque, before transparent
Mouse lock once API is available?
